#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
It has one loop which takes in n so it has a linear run complexity.


b)
Not 100% sure. It has a nested loop which makes my insticts say O(n^2) but because the inner loop is multiplying j and is not executing every time it is a O(log(n) therefore I believe the answer should be O(n log(n))


c)
O(n)
it has just one loop. so it has a linear run complexity.

## Exercise II

I would start at the max floors devided by 2 or half way up the building. I would drop the egg and if it breaks then I would repeat the process at the half of floors down below me. If the egg survives I would repeat this process at the half of floors above me. Eventually I would get the exact floor where the egg can survive from and have a run time complexity of O(log(n))
